# NIGERIA-IMAGE-CAPTIONING

The project is an image captioning system that generates textual descriptions for images. It uses deep learning models to analyze and understand the content of images, and then generates human-like captions to describe the visual content. The system aims to improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals and enhance image search capabilities. It was developed by Odulele Qudus Olamide (Matric Number: EES/18/19/0345) and Shotunde Emmanuel Opemipo (Matric Number: EES/18/19/0544).
