# Nigeria Image Captioning

This repository contains the code and resources for our final year project as computer engineering students at Olabisi Onabanjo University. The project focuses on Nigeria Image Captioning, a deep learning project that aims to generate descriptive captions for images depicting scenes from Nigeria. The goal of the project is to develop a model that can accurately describe images of Nigerian landscapes, cultural events, and everyday life.

## Project Description
The project involves the use of deep learning and natural language processing techniques to generate descriptive captions for images related to Nigeria. The deep learning model is trained on a dataset of images depicting various scenes from Nigeria, and its performance is evaluated based on the quality and relevance of the generated captions. The repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and caption generation.
